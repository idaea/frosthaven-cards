# Frosthaven Enhancements Tool

A tool for planning enhancements in Frosthaven. Shows the cards for any given class, then lets you place enhancements on specific dots, calculating their cost based on card level, enhancer level, previous enhancements, etc.

It remembers stickers you've placed, so you can come back and continue planning later.

## Running locally

Run `pnpm install` to set up the dependencies, then `pnpm run dev` to launch Vite's local dev server.
